# Brunel Autonomous Racing Work
detect_ZED14 is an old iteration of the team's self driving algorithm. In this program, an RC car is driven around a track defined by a set of blue and yellow cones. Attached to the car is a NVIDIA Jetson Nano board with a Stereolabs ZED2 stereo camera. the camera is used performs perception tasks, including object detection and object tracking, while simultaneously collecting pose estimation data with the camera's IMU sensor. Combining all this information, the car is able to generate a 3D Map of the track
